## Building the documentation locally

### 1. Install Python. 

If you are using MacOS, you probably already have a version of Python installed on your machine. You can verify this by running the following command.

`python --version`
`Python 2.7.2`


If your version of Python is Python 2.x.x, you also need to install Python3. This is because the PDF plugin only supports Python3. Follow the instructions on [this guide](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/osx/) to install Python3 properly. 

Once you are done, you will have two versions of Python on your machine; a version of python2 and a version of python3. 


### 2. Install Pip. 

Pip is most likely installed by default. However, you may need to upgrade pip to the latest version:

`pip install --upgrade pip`

If pip is not already installed on your machine, download get-pip.py to install pip for the first time. Then run the following command to install it:

`python get-pip.py`

### 3. Install pip packages

`pip install mkdocs`

`pip install mkdocs-material`

`pip install markdown-include`

`pip install pymdown-extensions`

### 4. Run mkdocs 

Clone this GitHub repository.

Navigate to the branch you want and the directory you want. For example, `cd docs-ei/en/micro-integrator/` in the `7.1.0` branch. Then run the following command:

`mkdocs serve --dirtyreload`
