# Configuring SAML2 Single-Sign-On Across Different WSO2 Products

With the SAML2 relying party capabilities of Carbon, it is possible to
set up Single Sign-On between different WSO2 Product instances where
WSO2 Identity Server acts as the identity provider while other WSO2
products act as the relying party. This topic provides instructions on
how to set up Single Sign-On between different WSO2 products.

## Step 1 - Installing the SAML2 relying party (SAML2 SSO Authenticator) feature in WSO2 Micro Integrator

>You only need to do this step if "SAML2 based Single Sign-On
authenticator" is not installed in your WSO2 product.


SAML2 relying party components are not shipped with the default Carbon
distribution. However, these bundles are packages that can be installed
as a feature, which is available in the online-hosted P2 repository.
Therefore, it is possible to install this feature with minimal effort
through the Carbon Feature Manager.

1.  Add the WSO2 online P2 repository as a new repository. Usually, the
    hosted P2 repository is available at this URL:
    http://dist.wso2.org/p2/carbon/releases/ (Carbon-Release-Version
    ). Learn how to add a repository to the Identity Server here .
2.  Search for the word "authenticator". Select "SAML2 based Single
    Sign-On authenticator" from the result and click "Install." See
    Installing Features .

## Step 2 - Configuring WSO2 Micro Integrator to use the SAML2-based authentication

After installing the SAML2 relying party components (SAML2 SSO
authenticator), it is necessary to configure the SAML2 SSO
authentication component to communicate with the Identity Server for
user authentication. By default, it is shipped with a sample configuration
for SAML2 SSO authenticator and requires minor modifications to prior to
setup.

To update this configuration, open the esb.toml file and update the following:

``` java
[config_heading]
Priority=10
LoginPage=/carbon/admin/login.jsp
ServiceProviderID=carbonServer
IdentityProviderSSOServiceURL=https://localhost:9443/samlsso
NameIDPolicyFormat=urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:unspecified
IdPCertAlias=wso2carbon
```

-   `          Authenticator disabled         ` - This should be set to
    `          false         ` .
-   `          Priority         ` - This is the priority level of the
    authenticator. In the Carbon Runtime, the authenticator with the
    highest priority will be picked up. This value should be greater
    than 5 in order to supersede the default username/password-based
    authenticator.
-   `          Parameter LoginPage         ` - This is the default login
    page URL of Carbon. All requests coming to this page will be
    intercepted for authentication. It is not necessary to change this
    value from the value given in the sample configuration.
-   `          Parameter ServiceProviderID         ` - This is the
    unique identifier for the Carbon Server in an SSO setup. This value
    should be used as the value of the issuer in the Identity Server
    configuration.
-   `          Parameter IdentityProviderSSOServiceURL         ` - This
    is the Identity Server URL to which the users will be redirected for
    authentication. It should have this format:
    `                     https://(host-name):(port)/samlsso                   `
    .
-   `          Parameter NameIDPolicyFormat         ` - This specifies
    the name identifier format that the Carbon server wants to receive
    in the subject of an assertion from a particular identity provider.
-   `          Parameter IdPCertAlias         ` - This is uncommented by
    default. This is the alias of the identity provider certificate.
    This is specifically used whenever a Carbon server uses IS as the
    identity provider. The configuration needs to be done at the relying
    party server's
    `          <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/conf/security/authenticators.xml         `
    file.

## Step 3 - Configuring the Identity Server as the Single Sign-On provider

Finally, you need to configure the Identity Server to act as the Single
Sign-on provider. Each relying party should be registered as a service
provider at the Identity Server-end. The following is a sample
configuration for registering a Carbon server as a service provider.

1.  Sign in. Enter your username and password to log on to the
    [Management
    Console](https://docs.wso2.com/display/IS510/Getting+Started+with+the+Management+Console)
    .
2.  Navigate to the **Main** menu to access the **Identity** menu. Click
    **Add** under **Service Providers** .
3.  Fill in the **Service Provider Name** and provide a brief
    **Description** of the service provider. Only **Service Provider
    Name** is a required field.
4.  Click **Register** to add the new service provider.
5.  Expand the **Inbound Authentication Configuration** section,
    followed by the **SAML2 Web SSO Configuration** section and click
    **Configure** .
6.  Fill in the form that appears.
    -   Specify the **Issuer** . This should be equal to the
        `            ServiceProviderID           ` value mentioned in
        the `esb.toml` file of the Micro Integrator.
    -   Specify the **Assertion Consumer URL** . This is the URL to
        which the browser should be redirected after the authentication
        is successful. It should have this format: `https://(host-name):(port)/acs`.
    -   Select **Use fully qualified username in SAML Response** if that
        feature is required.
    -   Select **Enable Response Signing** to sign the SAML2 Responses
        returned after the authentication.
    -   Select **Enable Assertion Signing** to sign the SAML2 Assertions
        returned after the authentication. SAML2 relying party
        components expect these assertions to be signed by the Identity
        Server.
    -   Select **Enable Signature Validation in Authentication Requests
        and Logout Requests** if you need this feature configured.
    -   Select **Enable Single Logout** so that all sessions are
        terminated once the user signs out from one server. You can
        enter a **Custom Logout URL** if required.
    -   Select **Enable Attribute Profile** to enable this and add a
        claim by entering the claim link and clicking the **Add Claim**
        button.
    -   Select **Enable Audience Restriction** to restrict the audience.
        You may add audience members using the **Audience** text box and
        clicking the **Add Audience** button.
7.  Expand the **Local & Outbound Authentication Configuration** section
    and do the following.  
    -   Select **Use tenant domain in local subject identifier**
        to append the tenant domain to the local subject identifier.
    -   Select **Use user store domain in local subject identifier**
        to append the user store domain that the user resides in the
        local subject identifier.

8.  Click the **Update** button to update the details of the service
    provider.
