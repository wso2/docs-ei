# Resolving Encrypted Secrets

There are two ways to resolve encrypted secrets in the `deployment.toml` file (stored in the `<MI_HOME>/conf` directory).

!!! Note
    If you have secured the plain text passwords in configuration files using Secure Vault, the keystore password and private key password of the product's [primary keystore](../../setup/security/configuring_keystores.md) will serve as the root passwords for Secure Vault. This is because the keystore passwords are needed to initialise the values encrypted by the **Secret Manager** in the **Secret Repository**. Therefore, the **Secret Callback handler** is used to resolve these passwords. The default secret CallbackHandler provides the two options given below. Read more about [Secure Vault concepts](../../references/security/customizing-secure-vault.md).

### Enter password in command-line
1. Start the server by running the product start up script from the `<MI_HOME>/bin/` directory as shown below.

   ```bash tab='On Linux'
   ./micro-integrator.sh
   ```

   ```bash tab='On Window'
   micro-integrator.bat
   ```

2. When you run the startup script, the following message will be prompted before starting the server: `[Enter KeyStore and Private Key Password:]`. This is because, in order to connect to the default user store, the encrypted passwords should be decrypted. The administrator starting the server must provide the private key and keystore passwords using the command-line. Note that passwords are hidden from the terminal and log files.

### Start server as a background job

If you start the Micro Integrator as a background job, you will not be able to provide password values on the command line. Therefore, you must start the server in "daemon" mode as explained below.

1. Create a new file in the MI_HOME directory. The file should be named according to your OS as explained below.

    * For Linux: The file name should be `password-tmp`.
    * For Windows: The file name should be `password-tmp.txt`.

    !!! Note
        When you start the server, the keystore password will be picked from this new file. Note that this file is automatically deleted from the file system after the server starts. Therefore, the admin has to create a new text file every time the server starts.

        Alternatively, if you want to retain the password file after the server starts, the file should be named as follows:

        * For Linux: The file name should be `password-persist`
        * For Windows: The file name should be `password-persist.txt`

2. Add the primary keystore password (which is "wso2carbon" by default) to the new file and save. By default, the password provider assumes that both private key and keystore passwords are the same. If not, the private key password must be entered in the second line of the file.

3. Now, start the server as a background process by running the following command.

    ```bash tab='On Linux'
    ./micro-integrator.sh start
    ```

    ```bash tab='On Window'
    micro-integrator.bat start
    ```
