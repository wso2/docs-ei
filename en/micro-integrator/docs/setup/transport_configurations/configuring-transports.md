# Configuring Transports

A transport protocol is responsible for carrying messages that are in a specific format. WSO2 Micro Integrator supports all the widely used transports including HTTP/S, JMS, VFS, as well as domain-specific transports like FIX. Each transport provides a receiver implementation for receiving messages, and a sender implementation for sending messages.

## Configuring the HTTP/HTTPS transport

The HTTP and HTTPS passthrough transports are enabled by default in the Micro Integrator. 

See the [complete list of HTTP/HTTPS parameters](../../../references/config-catalog/#http-transport).

### Number of HTTP Listeners

The default HTTP transport (PassThrough transport) of WSO2 Micro Integrator has 4 HTTP/HTTPS listneres configured. This includes 2 `         PassThroughHttpListener        ` threads and 2 `         PassThroughHttpSSLListener        ` threads.

You can configure the number of listeners for the HTTP transport in the deployment.toml file:

```toml
[passthru_properties]
io_threads_per_reactor=2
```
You are able to define any number of listeners (by updating the `io_threads_per_reactor` value) as there is no maximum limit defined in the code level.

!!! Note
    The number of listener threads is double the value of the `io_threads_per_reactor` property because the same number of `PassThroughHttpListener` and `PassThroughHttpSSLListener` threads are created. For example, if you defined the value for the `io_threads_per_reactor` property as 5, you have 5 `PassThroughHttpListener` threads and 5 `PassThroughHttpSSLListener` threads. Therefore, the total number of listeners are 10.

### Connection Throttling

With the default HTTP transport (PassThrough transport) you can enable connection throttling to restrict the number of simultaneous open connections. 

To enable connection throttling, update the following property in the deployment.toml file:

```toml
[transport.http]
max_open_connections = 2
```

This will restrict simultaneous open incoming connections to 2. To disable throttling, delete the `max_open_connections` setting or set it to -1.

!!! Info
    Connection throttling is never exact. For example, setting this property to 2 will result in roughly two simultaneous open connections at any given time.

### Verifying certificate revocation

The default HTTPS transport listener (Secured Passthrough) and transport sender can verify with the certificate authority whether a certificate is still trusted before it completes an SSL connection. If the certificate authority has revoked the certificate, a connection will not be completed. 

When this feature is enabled, the transport listener verifies client
certificates when a client tries to make an HTTPS connection with the
Micro Integrator. The transport sender verifies server
certificates when the Micro Integrator tries to make an HTTPS
connection with a backend server.Â 

When this feature is enabled, the Micro Integrator attempts to
use the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) to verify with the
certificate authority at the handshake phase of the SSL protocol. If the
OCSP is not supported by the certificate authority, the Micro Integrator uses Certified Revocation Lists (CRL) instead. The verification
process checks all the certificates in a certificate chain.

To enable this feature for the HTTP passthrough, add the following parameters for the HTTP transport receiver and sender in the deployment.toml file:

```toml tab='Passthrough Listener'
[transport.http]
listener.certificate_revocation_verifier_enable = true
listener.certificate_revocation_cache_size = 1024
listener.certificate_revocation_cache_delay = 1000

``` 

```toml tab='Passthrough Sender'
[transport.http]
sender.certificate_revocation_verifier_enable = true
sender.certificate_revocation_cache_size = 1024
sender.certificate_revocation_cache_delay = 1000

``` 

### Configuring Transport Level Security  

Micro Integrator supports both SSL and TLS protocols. But since the SSL protocol is vulnerable to Poodle attacks, it is necessary to make sure that only TLS protocol versions are enabled.

!!! Note
    It is necessary to disable SSL in Carbon servers because of a bug (Poodle Attack) in the SSL protocol that could expose critical data encrypted between clients and servers. The Poodle Attack makes the system vulnerable by telling the client that the server does not support the more secure TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocol, and thereby forces it to connect via SSL. The effect of this bug can be mitigated by disabling the SSL protocol for your server.

To configure the enabled protocols, update the following property in the deployment.toml file:
```toml
[transport.http]
listener.secured_protocols = "TLSv1,TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2"
sender.secured_protocols = "TLSv1,TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2"
```
### Disabling weak ciphers

A cipher is an algorithm for performing encryption or decryption. When you set the sslprotocol of your server to TLS, the TLS and the default ciphers get enabled without considering the strength of the ciphers. This is a security risk as weak ciphers, also known as EXPORT ciphers, can make your system vulnerable to attacks such as the Logjam attack on Diffie-Hellman key exchange. The Logjam attack is also called the Man-in-the-Middle attack. It downgrades your connection's encryption to a less-secured level (e.g., 512 bit) that can be decrypted with sufficient processing power.

To prevent these types of security attacks, it is encouraged to disable the weak ciphers. You can enable only the ciphers that you want the server to support in a comma-separated list in the ciphers  attribute. 

To configure the enabled ciphers, update the following property in the deployment.toml file:
```toml
[transport.https]
listener.parameter.PreferredCiphers = "TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256,TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256,TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256,TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA,TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA,TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA,TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256"
```

!!! Note
    To check the above configuration changes related to SSL. Download [TestSSLServer.jar](https://docs.wso2.com/download/attachments/53125465/TestSSLServer.jar?version=1&modificationDate=1471859455000&api=v2) and test with the following command.

    $ java -jar TestSSLServer.jar localhost 8253
    
## Configuring the VFS transport

The VFS transport is enabled by defualt in the Micro Integrator. The VFS transport supports the **SFTP protocol** with **Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)**. The configuration is identical to other protocols with the only difference being the URL prefixes and parameters. 

For more information, see [VFS URL parameters](../../references/synapse-properties/vfs-transport-parameters).

See the [complete list of VFS parameters](../../../references/config-catalog/#vfs-transport).

<!--
## Connecting to the Local transport

The local transport is enabled by defualt in the Micro Integrator. 

See the [complete list of local parameters](../../../references/config-catalog/#local-transport).
-->

## Configuring the TCP transport

To enable the TCP transport listener and sender, set the following parameters to `true` in the deployment.toml file (stored in the `MI_HOME/conf` directory).
Change the listener port value as required.

```toml
[transport.tcp]
listener.enable = true
listener.port = 6060
sender.enable = true
```

## Configuring the MSMQ transport

To enable the MSMQ transport listener and sender, set the following parameters to `true` in the deployment.toml file (stored in the `MI_HOME/conf` directory).

```toml
[transport.msmq]

### Configuring Sample FIX Applications

If you are using a binary distribution of Quickfix/J, the two samples (FIX messages sender/reveiver)
and their configuration files are all packed to two JAR files called
`quickfixj-examples-banzai-2.1.1.jar` and `quickfixj-examples-executor-2.1.1.jar`. You will have to extract the
JAR file, modify the configuration files and pack them to a JAR file
again under the same name.

Change the banzai.cfg file in quickfixj-examples-executor-2.1.1.jar (/quickfix/examples/banzai) by changing `TargetCompID` to `SYNAPSE`
```

## Configuring the MQTT transport

To enable the MQTT transport listener and sender, set the following parameters to `true` in the deployment.toml file (stored in the `MI_HOME/conf` directory).

```toml
[transport.mqtt]
listener.enable = false
sender.enable = false
```
## Configuring the Websocket transport

To enable the Websocket transport sender, set the following parameters to `true` in the deployment.toml file (stored in the `MI_HOME/conf` directory).

```toml
[transport.ws]
sender.enable = false
```

To enable the **secured** Websocket transport sender, set the following parameters to `true` in the deployment.toml file (stored in the `MI_HOME/conf` directory.

```toml
[transport.wss]
sender.enable = false
```

## Configuring the UDP transport

To enable the MSMQ transport listener and sender, set the following parameters to `true` in the deployment.toml file (stored in the `MI_HOME/conf` directory).

```toml
[transport.udp]
listener.enable = false
sender.enable =false
```
## Configuring the MailTo transport 

To enable the MailTo transport listener and sender, set the following parameters to `true` in the deployment.toml file (stored in the `MI_HOME/conf` directory).

-	Enabling the MailTo listener

	```toml
	[transport.mail.listener]
	enable = true
	```

-	Configuring the MailTo sender

	```toml
	[[transport.mail.sender]]
	name = "mailto"
	parameter.hostname = "smtp.gmail.com"
	parameter.port = "587"
	parameter.enable_tls = true
	parameter.auth = true
	parameter.username = "demo_user"
	parameter.password = "mailpassword"
	parameter.from = "demo_user@wso2.com"
	```

	!!! Note
		In addition to enabling the MailTO transport, the following parameters are used in the above configuration to set a default email account as the mail sender. You can override this default mail sender by specifying an email sender account within your mediation sequence.

		-	`parameter.from` : The email address from which mails will be sent.
		-	`parameter.username` : The user name of the email account (mail sender). Note that in some email service providers, the user name is the same as the email address specified for the 'From' parameter.
		-	`parameter.password` : The password of the email account (mail sender).

	If you want to use multiple mail boxes to send emails, make a copy of the default MailTo sender configuration in the `MI_HOME/conf/deployment.toml` file and change the transport sender name. For example, add `mailtoWSO2` as the name.

	For a list of parameters supported by the MailTo transport sender, see [SMTP Package Summary](https://javaee.github.io/javamail/docs/api/com/sun/mail/smtp/package-summary.html). You can add these parameters into the mail transport as custom parameters by appending relevant parameters surrounded by single quotes into the parameter section. For example, to add `mail.smtp.localport` parameter into the mail transport, toml configuration would be `parameter.'mail.smtp.localport'=5000`.
	
	In addition to the parameters described there, the MailTo transport sender supports the following custom parameters.

	-	`transport.mail.SMTPBccAddresses` : If one or more e-mail addresses need to be specified as BCC addresses for outgoing mails, this parameter can be used. You can enter a comma-separated list of e-mail addresses.
	-	`transport.mail.Format` : Format of the outgoing mail. Possible values are <b>Text</b> and <b>Multipart</b>.

## Configuring the JMS transport

To enable the JMS transport sender and listener in the Micro Integrator, you need to update the deployment.toml file (stored in the `MI_HOME/conf` directory) with the connection parameters for your JMS broker you are using. **Be sure** to add the required libraries to the `MI_HOME/lib` directory.

## Configuring the Multi-HTTPS transport

This transport is similar to the HTTPS passthrough transport, but it allows you to have different SSL profiles with separate truststores and keystores for different hosts using the same WSO2 Micro Integrator. It can listen to different host IPs and ports for incoming HTTPS connections, and each IP/Port will have a separate SSL profile configured.
