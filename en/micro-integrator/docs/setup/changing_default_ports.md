# Changing the Default Ports

When you run multiple WSO2 products, multiple instances of the same
product, or multiple WSO2 product clusters on the same server or virtual
machines (VMs), you must change their default ports with an offset value
to avoid port conflicts. Port offset defines the number by which all
ports defined in the runtime such as the HTTP/S ports will be changed.
For example, if the default HTTP port is 9763 and the port offset is 1,
the effective HTTP port will change to 9764. For each additional WSO2
product instance, you set the port offset to a unique value.
The default port offset value is 0. There are two ways to set an offset
to a port:

-   Pass the port offset to the server during startup. The following
    command starts the server with the default port incremented by 3
    `          :./wso2server.sh -DportOffset=3         `
-   Set the Ports section of
    `          <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/conf/carbon.xml         ` as
    follows: `          <Offset>3</Offset>         `

When you set the server-level port offset in WSO2 AS as shown above,
[all the ports](_Default_Ports_of_WSO2_Products_) used by the server
will change automatically. However, this may not be the case with some
WSO2 products such as WSO2 APIM and WSO2 AM. See the [product
documentation](https://docs.wso2.com/dashboard.action) for instructions
that are specific to your product.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Common ports

The following ports are common to all WSO2 products that provide the
given feature. Some features are bundled in the WSO2 Carbon platform
itself and therefore are available in all WSO2 products by default.

[Management console
ports](#DefaultPortsofWSO2Products-Managementconsoleports) \| [LDAP

#### Management console ports

WSO2 products that provide a management console (except WSO2 Enterprise
Integrator) use the following servlet transport ports:

-   9443 - HTTPS servlet transport (the default URL of the management
    console is https://localhost:9443/carbon )
-   9763 - HTTP servlet transport

WSO2 Enterprise Integrator (WSO2 EI) uses the following ports to access
the management console:

-   9443 - HTTPS servlet transport for the **ESB** runtime (the default
    URL of the management console is https://localhost:9443/carbon )  
      
-   9445 - HTTPS servlet transport for the **EI-Business Process**
    runtime (the default URL of the management console is
    https://localhost:9445/carbon )
-   9444 - Used for the **EI-Analytics** management console

#### LDAP server ports

Provided by default in the WSO2 Carbon platform.

-   10389 - Used in WSO2 products that provide an embedded LDAP server

#### KDC ports

-   8000 - Used to expose the Kerberos key distribution center server

#### JMX monitoring ports

WSO2 Carbon platform uses TCP ports to monitor a running Carbon instance
using a JMX client such as JConsole. By default, JMX is enabled in all
products. You can disable it using
`         <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/conf/etc/jmx.xml        ` file.

-   11111 - RMIRegistry port. Used to monitor Carbon remotely
-   9999 - RMIServer port. Used along with the RMIRegistry port when
    Carbon is monitored from a JMX client that is behind a firewall

#### Clustering ports

To cluster any running Carbon instance, either one of the following
ports must be opened.

-   45564 - Opened if the membership scheme is multicast
-   4000 - Opened if the membership scheme is wka

#### Random ports

Certain ports are randomly opened during server startup. This is due to
specific properties and configurations that become effective when the
product is started. Note that the IDs of these random ports will change
every time the server is started.

-   A random TCP port will open at server startup because of the
    `          -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote         ` property set in
    the server startup script. This property is used for the
    JMX monitoring facility in JVM.
-   A random UDP port is opened at server startup due to the log4j
    appender ( `          SyslogAppender         ` ), which is
    configured in the
    `          <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/conf/log4j.properties         `
    file.

### Enterprise Mobility Manager

The following ports need to be opened for Android and iOS devices so
that it can connect to Google Cloud Messaging (GCM)/Firebase Cloud
Messaging (FCM) and APNS (Apple Push Notification Service), and enroll
to WSO2 EMM.

Android:  
The ports to open are 5228, 5229 and 5230. GCM/FCM typically only uses
5228, but it sometimes uses 5229 and 5230.  
GCM/FCM does not provide specific IPs, so it is recommended to allow the
firewall to accept outgoing connections to all IP addresses contained in
the IP blocks listed in Google's ASN of 15169.

iOS:

-   5223 - TCP port used by devices to communicate to APNs servers
-   2195 - TCP port used to send notifications to APNs
-   2196 - TCP port  used by the APNs feedback service
-   443 - TCP port used as a fallback on Wi-Fi, only when devices are
    unable to communicate to APNs on port 5223  
    The APNs servers use load balancing. The devices will not always
    connect to the same public IP address for notifications. The entire
    17.0.0.0/8 address block is assigned to Apple, so it is best to
    allow this range in the firewall settings.

API Manager:

!!! info

The following WSO2 API Manager ports are only applicable to WSO2 EMM
1.1.0 onwards.


-   10397 - Thrift client and server ports
-   8280, 8243 - NIO/PT transport ports

### IoT Server

The following ports need to be opened for WSO2 IoT Server, and Android
and iOS devices so that it can connect to Google Cloud Messaging
(GCM)/Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) and APNS (Apple Push Notification
Service), and enroll to WSO2 IoT Server.
