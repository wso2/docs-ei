# Working with Admin Services

WSO2 products are managed internally using SOAP Web services known as
**admin services** . WSO2 products come with a management console UI,
which communicates with these admin services to facilitate
administration capabilities through the UI.

A service in WSO2 products is defined by the following components:

-   Service component: provides the actual service
-   UI component: provides the Web user interface to the service
-   Service stub: provides the interface to invoke the service generated
    from the service WSDL

There can be instances where you want to call back-end Web services
directly. For example, in test automation, to minimize the overhead of
having to change automation scripts whenever a UI change happens,
developers prefer to call the underlying services in scripts. The topics
below explain how to discover and invoke these services from your
applications.

### Discovering the admin services

By default, the WSDLs of admin services are hidden from consumers. Given
below is how to discover them using the
[OSGi](https://www.osgi.org/developer/) console.

1.  Set the `           <HideAdminServiceWSDLs>          ` element to
    false in the
    `           <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/conf/carbon.xml          `
    file.
2.  Go to `            <PRODUCT_HOME>/bin/           ` folder and start
    the WSO2 product as follows,

    **In Linux Environment**

    ``` java
        sh wso2server.sh -DosgiConsole
    ```

    **In Windows Environment**

    ``` java
            wso2server.bat -DosgiConsole
    ```

3.  When the server is started, hit the enter/return key several times
    to get the OSGI shell in the console.
4.  In the OSGI shell, type:
    `           osgi> listAdminServices          `
5.  The list of admin services of your product are listed. For
    example:  
    <a href=""><img src="../../assets/img/listAdminServices.png"></a>
6.  To see the service contract of an admin service, select the admin
    service's URL and then paste it in your browser with **?wsdl** at
    the end. For example:  
    `            https://localhost:9443/services/RemoteUserStoreManagerService?wsdl           `

    > In products like WSO2 ESB and WSO2 API Manager, the port is 8243
        (assuming 0 port offset). However, you should be accessing the Admin
        Services via the management console port, which is 9443 when there
        is no port offset.


7.  Note that the admin service's URL appears as follows in the list you
    discovered in step 6:

    ``` java
        RemoteUserStoreManagerService, RemoteUserStoreManagerService, https://<host IP>:9443/services/RemoteUserStoreManagerService/  
    ```

    > After discovering admin service you can restart the server without `-DosgiConsole`


### Invoking an admin service

Admin services are secured using common types of security protocols such
as HTTP basic authentication, WS-Security username token, and session
based authentication to prevent anonymous invocations. For example, the
`          UserAdmin         ` Web service is secured with the HTTP
basic authentication. To invoke a service, you do the following:

1.  Authenticate yourself and get the session cookie.
2.  Generate the client stubs to access the back-end Web services.

> To generate the stubs, you can write your own client program using the
Axis2 client API or use an existing tool like
[SoapUI](http://www.soapui.org/) (4.5.1 or later) or wsdl2java.

The wsdl2java tool, which comes with WSO2 products by default hides all
the complexity and presents you with a proxy to the back-end service.
The stub generation happens during the project build process within the
Maven POM files. It uses the Maven ant run plug-in to execute the
wsdl2java tool.

You can also use the Java client program given
[here](https://svn.wso2.org/repos/wso2/people/asela/user-mgt/remote-user-api/4.2.X/)
to invoke admin services. All dependency JAR files that you need to run
this client are found in the `          /lib         ` directory.

#### Authenticate the user

The example code below authenticates the user and gets the session
cookie:

``` java
     import org.apache.axis2.AxisFault;  
     import org.apache.axis2.transport.http.HTTPConstants;  
     import org.wso2.carbon.authenticator.stub.AuthenticationAdminStub;  
     import org.wso2.carbon.authenticator.stub.LoginAuthenticationExceptionException;  
     import org.wso2.carbon.authenticator.stub.LogoutAuthenticationExceptionException;  
     import org.apache.axis2.context.ServiceContext;  
     import java.rmi.RemoteException;  

     public class LoginAdminServiceClient {  
       private final String serviceName = "AuthenticationAdmin";  
         private AuthenticationAdminStub authenticationAdminStub;  
         private String endPoint;  

         public LoginAdminServiceClient(String backEndUrl) throws AxisFault {  
           this.endPoint = backEndUrl + "/services/" + serviceName;  
           authenticationAdminStub = new AuthenticationAdminStub(endPoint);  
         }  

         public String authenticate(String userName, String password) throws RemoteException,  
                                           LoginAuthenticationExceptionException {  

           String sessionCookie = null;  

           if (authenticationAdminStub.login(userName, password, "localhost")) {  
             System.out.println("Login Successful");  

             ServiceContext serviceContext = authenticationAdminStub.  
                 _getServiceClient().getLastOperationContext().getServiceContext();  
             sessionCookie = (String) serviceContext.getProperty(HTTPConstants.COOKIE_STRING);  
             System.out.println(sessionCookie);  
           }  

           return sessionCookie;  
         }  

         public void logOut() throws RemoteException, LogoutAuthenticationExceptionException {  
           authenticationAdminStub.logout();  
         }  
     }
```

> To resolve dependency issues, if any, add the following dependency JARs
location to the class path: `<PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/components/plugins`.

> The the `AuthenticationAdminStub` class requires `org.apache.axis2.context.ConfigurationContext` as
a parameter. You can give a null value there.

#### Generate the client stubs

After authenticating the user, give the retrieved admin cookie with the
service endpoint URL as shown in the sample below. The service
management service name is ServiceAdmin. You can find its URL (e.g.,
`           https://localhost:9443/services/ServiceAdmin          ` ) in
the `           service.xml          ` file in the
`           META-INF          ` folder in the respective bundle that you
find in
`           <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/components/plugins          ` .

``` java
     import org.apache.axis2.AxisFault;  
     import org.apache.axis2.client.Options;  
     import org.apache.axis2.client.ServiceClient;  
     import org.wso2.carbon.service.mgt.stub.ServiceAdminStub;  
     import org.wso2.carbon.service.mgt.stub.types.carbon.ServiceMetaDataWrapper;  
     import java.rmi.RemoteException;  

     public class ServiceAdminClient {  
       private final String serviceName = "ServiceAdmin";  
       private ServiceAdminStub serviceAdminStub;  
       private String endPoint;  

       public ServiceAdminClient(String backEndUrl, String sessionCookie) throws AxisFault {  
         this.endPoint = backEndUrl + "/services/" + serviceName;  
         serviceAdminStub = new ServiceAdminStub(endPoint);  
         //Authenticate Your stub from sessionCooke  
         ServiceClient serviceClient;  
         Options option;  

         serviceClient = serviceAdminStub._getServiceClient();  
         option = serviceClient.getOptions();  
         option.setManageSession(true);  
         option.setProperty(org.apache.axis2.transport.http.HTTPConstants.COOKIE_STRING, sessionCookie);  
       }  

       public void deleteService(String[] serviceGroup) throws RemoteException {  
         serviceAdminStub.deleteServiceGroups(serviceGroup);  

       }  

       public ServiceMetaDataWrapper listServices() throws RemoteException {  
         return serviceAdminStub.listServices("ALL", "*", 0);  
       }  
     }
```

The following sample code lists the back-end Web services:

``` java
     import org.wso2.carbon.authenticator.stub.LoginAuthenticationExceptionException;  
     import org.wso2.carbon.authenticator.stub.LogoutAuthenticationExceptionException;  
     import org.wso2.carbon.service.mgt.stub.types.carbon.ServiceMetaData;  
     import org.wso2.carbon.service.mgt.stub.types.carbon.ServiceMetaDataWrapper;  

     import java.rmi.RemoteException;  

     public class ListServices {  
       public static void main(String[] args)  
           throws RemoteException, LoginAuthenticationExceptionException,  
               LogoutAuthenticationExceptionException {  
         System.setProperty("javax.net.ssl.trustStore", "$ESB_HOME/repository/resources/security/wso2carbon.jks");  
         System.setProperty("javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword", "wso2carbon");  
         System.setProperty("javax.net.ssl.trustStoreType", "JKS");  
         String backEndUrl = "https://localhost:9443";  

         LoginAdminServiceClient login = new LoginAdminServiceClient(backEndUrl);  
         String session = login.authenticate("admin", "admin");  
         ServiceAdminClient serviceAdminClient = new ServiceAdminClient(backEndUrl, session);  
         ServiceMetaDataWrapper serviceList = serviceAdminClient.listServices();  
         System.out.println("Service Names:");  
         for (ServiceMetaData serviceData : serviceList.getServices()) {  
           System.out.println(serviceData.getName());  
         }  

         login.logOut();  
       }  
     }  
```
