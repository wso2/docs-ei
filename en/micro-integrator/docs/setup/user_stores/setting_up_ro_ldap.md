# Setting up a Read-Only LDAP

Follow the steps given below to set up a read-only LDAP user store:

## Connect the server to the user store

Open the <MI_HOME>/conf/deployment.toml file and apply the following changes:

PLAIN_TEXT - Plain text passwords.</p>
<p>If you just configure as SHA, It is considered as SHA-1, It is always better to configure algorithm with higher bit value as digest bit size would be increased.<br />
<br />
Most of the LDAP servers (such as OpenLdap, OpenDJ, AD, ApacheDS and etc..) are supported to store password as salted hashed values (SSHA)<br />
Therefore WSO2 EI server just wants to feed password into the connected user store as a plain text value. Then LDAP user store can store them as salted hashed value. To feed the plain text into the LDAP server, you need to set PasswordHashMethod to “PLAIN_TEXT”<br />
But; if your LDAP does not support to store user password as hashed values. You can configure WSO2 server to hash the password and feeds the hashed password into the LDAP server. Then you need to configure PasswordHashMethod property with SHA (SHA-1), SHA-256, SHA-512. Please note WSO2 server cannot create a salted hashed password (SSHA) to feed into the LDAP.</p></td>

In some user stores, there are policies to limit the number of records that can be returned from the query. Setting the value 0 it will list the maximum results returned by the user store. If you need to increase that you need to set it in the user store level.<br />

## Create admin credentials in the user store

Be sure that the user administrator is updated:

1. Get an encrypted password for the administrator.
2. Open the esb.toml file and update the following:
    ```java
    [secrets]
    ldap_password = "encrypted_value_1"
    ```
3. Update the administrator credentials in the esb.toml file:
   ```java
   [super_admin]
   username = "admin"
   password = "admin"
   create_super_admin = true

   ```
