# Sending a Simple Message to a Service

## What you'll build

Let’s try a simple scenario where a patient makes an inquiry specifying the doctor's specialization (category) to retrieve a list of doctors that match the specialization. The required information is available in a  back-end micro service. 

To implement this use case, you will create a REST API resource and other artifacts using WSO2 Integration Studio, and then deploy them in the embedded WSO2 Micro Integrator instance. The default API resource will be configured to receive the client request in place of the back-end service, thereby decoupling the client and the back-end service. The response message with the requested doctor details will be routed back to the client through the same API resource.

## Let's get started!

### Step 1: Set up the workspace

-  Select the relevant [WSO2 Integration Studio](https://wso2.com/integration/tooling/) based on your operating system and extract the ZIP file.  The path to the extracted folder is referred to as `MI_TOOLING_HOME` throughout this tutorial.
-  Download the [CLI Tool](https://wso2.com/integration/micro-integrator/install/) for monitoring artifact deployments.

### Step 2: Develop the integration artifacts

Follow the instructions given in this section to create and configure the required artifacts.

#### Create an ESB Config project

To create an ESB solution consisting of an **ESB config** project and a **Composite Application** project:

1.  Open **WSO2 Integration Studio**.
2.  Go to **ESB Project** and click **Create New**.
    ![](../../assets/img/tutorials/119132413/119132414.png)

3.  Enter `SampleServices` as the project name. Be sure to select the following check boxes so that the relevant
    projects will be created.
    -   **Create Registry Resources Project**
    -   **Create Composite Application Project**
    -   **Create Connector Exported Project**

    ![](../../assets/img/tutorials/119132413/esb-solution-dialog.png)

4.  Click **Finish**.  
    The created projects are saved in the **Project Explorer** as shown below:

    ![](../../assets/img/tutorials/119132413/project-explorer-simple-service.png)

#### Create an Endpoint

An Endpoint artifact is required for the purpose of exposing the URL that connects to the back-end service.

1. Right-click **SampleServices** in the Project Explorer and navigate to **New -> Endpoint**.
2. Ensure that **Create a New Endpoint** is selected and click **Next**.
3. Enter the information given below to create the new endpoint.  
    <table>
    <thead>
      <tr class="header">
         <th>Property</th>
         <th>Value</th>
         <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr class="odd">
         <td>Endpoint Name</td>
         <td><code>               QueryDoctorEP              </code></td>
         <td>The name of the endpoint.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="even">
         <td>Endpoint Type</td>
         <td><code>HTTP Endpoint</code></td>
         <td>Indicates that the back-end service is HTTP.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="odd">
         <td>URI Template</td>
         <td>
            <code>http://localhost:9090/healthcare/{uri.var.category}</code>
         </td>
         <td>The template for the request URL expected by the back-end service. In this case, the variable 'category' that needs to be included in the request for querying doctors is represented as <code>{uri.var.category}</code> in the template.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="even">
         <td>Method</td>
         <td><code>GET</code></td>
         <td>Indicates that we are creating this endpoint for GET requests that are sent to the back-end service.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="odd">
         <td>Static Endpoint</td>
         <td><br/>
         </td>
         <td>Select this option because we are going to use this endpoint only in this ESB Config project and will not reuse it in other projects.</br/> <b>Note</b>: If you need to create a reusable endpoint, save it as a Dynamic Endpoint in either the Configuration or Governance Registry.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="even">
         <td>Save Endpoint in</td>
         <td><code>               SampleServices              </code></td>
         <td>This is the ESB Config project we created in the last section</td>
      </tr>
     </tbody>
    </table>

    ![](../../assets/img/tutorials/119132413/create-endpoint-artifact.png)

4.  Click **Finish**.  
    The **QueryDoctorEP** endpoint is saved in the `           endpoints          ` folder within the ESB Config project you created.  
    ![](../../assets/img/tutorials/119132413/endpoint-project-explorer.png)

#### Create a REST API

A REST API is required for receving the client response and the REST resource within the API will define the mediation logic that will send requests to the Healthcare back-end service and retrieve the available doctor information.

1.  In the Project Explorer, right-click **SampleServices** and navigate to **New -> REST API**.
2.  Ensure **Create A New API Artifact** is selected and click **Next**.
3.  Enter the details given below to create a new REST API.
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Property</th>
        <th>Value</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Name</td>
        <td><code>HealthcareAPI</code></td>
        <td>
          The name of the REST API.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Context</td>
        <td><code>/healthcare </code></td>
        <td>
          Here you are anchoring the API in the <code>/healthcare </code> context. This will become part of the name of the generated URL used by the client when sending requests to Healthcare service. For example, setting the context to /healthcare defines that the API will only handle HTTP requests where the URL path starts <b><code>http://<host>:<port>/healthcare</b>.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Save location</td>
        <td>
          SampleServices
        </td>
        <td>
          This is the ESB config project where the artifact will be saved.
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
    ![](../../assets/img/tutorials/119132413/create-rest-api.png)

4.  Click **Finish**.

#### Define the mediation flow 

Once the API resource is created, the design view of the `           HealthcareAPI.xml          ` file will appear as shown below.

!!! Note
    - The top part of the canvas is the **In sequence**, which controls how incoming messages are mediated.
    - The middle part of the canvas is the **Out sequence**, which controls how responses are handled. In this case, a **Send** mediator is already in place to send responses back to the requesting client.
    - The bottom part of the canvas is the **Fault sequence**, which allows you to configure how to handle messages when an error occurs (for more information, see [Error Handling](../../../references/error_handling)).

![](../../assets/img/tutorials/119132413/119132425.png)

You can now start configuring the API resource.

1.  Double-click the **Resource** icon on the left side of the canvas.  
    The properties for the API resource appear on the **Properties** tab at the bottom of the window. If they do not appear, you can right-click the **Resource** icon and click **Show Properties View**.
2.  On the **Properties** tab, provide the following as **Basic** properties:
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Property</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Url Style</td>
        <td>
          Click the respective <b>Value</b> field, click the down arrow, and then select <b>URI_TEMPLATE</b> from the list.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>URI-Template</td>
        <td>
          Enter <code>/querydoctor/{category}</code> . This defines the request URL format. In this case, the full request URL format is <code>http://host:port/querydoctor/{category}</code> where <code>{category}</code> is a variable.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Methods</td>
        <td>
          Check if the value of <b>Get</b> is set to true. This defines that the API resource only handles the requests where the HTTP method is GET.
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    ![](../../assets/img/tutorials/119132413/119132424.png)

3.  You can now configure the In sequence to handle requests from the client:

    1.  From the **Mediators** palette, click and drag a **Log** mediator to the In sequence (the top of the canvas).

        !!! Note
            The Log mediator logs messages when the request is received by the In sequence of the API resource. In this scenario, let's configure the Log mediator to display the following message: “Welcome to the HealthcareService”.

    2. With the Log mediator selected, access the **Property** tab and fill in the information in the table below:
        <table>
      <tr class="header">
         <th>Field</th>
         <th>Value</th>
         <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
   <tbody>
      <tr class="odd">
         <td>Log Category</td>
         <td><code>                 INFO                </code></td>
         <td>Indicates that the log contains an informational message.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="even">
         <td>Log Level</td>
         <td><code>                 Custom                </code></td>
         <td>When <code>                 Custom                </code> is selected, only specified properties will be logged by this mediator.
         </td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="odd">
         <td>Log Separator</td>
         <td><code>                 (blank)                </code></td>
         <td>Since there is only one property that is being logged, you do not require a separator. Therefore, leave this field blank.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="even">
         <td>Properties</td>
         <td><br />
         </td>
         <td>
            <div class="content-wrapper">
               To extract the stock symbol from the request and print a welcome message in the log, click the '+' icon in the <strong>Properties</strong> section, and then add the following values:<br />
               <ul>
                  <li><strong>Name</strong>: <code>Log Property message</code></li>
                  <li><strong>Type</strong>: <code>LITERAL</code><br />
                     (We select LITERAL because the required log message is a static value.)
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Value/Expression</strong> : <code>"Welcome to HealthcareService"</code></li>
               </ul>
               <p><img src="/assets/img/tutorials/119132413/119132423.png" width="546" height="369" /></p>
            </div>
         </td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="odd">
         <td>Description</td>
         <td><code>Request Log</code></td>
         <td>The <strong>Description</strong> field provides the name that appears for the Log mediator icon in the design view.</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
        </table>

        ![](../../assets/img/tutorials/119132413/119132422.png)

    3.  Click **OK** to save the Log mediator configuration.
    4.  Configure the **Send** mediator to send the request message to the `HealthcareService` endpoint.
        1. From the **Mediators** palette, click and drag a **Send** mediator to the In sequence adjoining the Log mediator you added above.
        2. From the **Defined EndPoints** palette, click and drag the **QueryDoctorEP** endpoint, which we created, right next to the empty space of the **Send** mediator.

        ![](../../assets/img/tutorials/119132413/119132421.png)

4.  Configure the Out sequence to send the response from the Healthcare service back to the client. 

    For this, we use a **Send** mediator with no output endpoint defined, which defaults to sending the response back to the requesting client. From the **Mediators** palette, click and drag a **Send** mediator to the Out Sequence (the bottom part of the canvas).  

    ![](../../assets/img/tutorials/119132413/119132420.png)

You have successfully created all the artifacts that are required for sending a request through the Micro Integrator to the back-end service. 

### Step 3: Package the artifacts

Package the artifacts in your composite application project (SampleServicesCompositeApplication project) to be able to deploy the artifacts in the server.

1.  Open the `pom.xml` file in the composite application project POM editor.
2.  Ensure that the following artifacts are selected in the POM file.

    -   `HealthcareAPI`
    -   `QueryDoctorEP`

3.  Save the project.

<!--
### Packaging the artifacts

You need to Package the `         QueryDoctorEP        ` endpoint and
the `         HealthcareAP        ` I resource into the [Composite
Application (C-App)
project](https://docs.wso2.com/display/EI600/Key+Concepts#KeyConcepts-CompositeApplicationproject)
named `         SampleServicesCompositeApplication        ` .

!!! note

The `         SampleCApp        ` Composite Application project is
generated and is listed under SampleApp project in the Project Explorer.
The **Composite Application Project POM Editor** can be accessed by
selecting the `         pom.xml        ` file listed under
SampleServicesCompositeApplication project.


Follow the steps given below to create the CAR file using one of the
following options:

-   [**C-App project**](#d315a56d2d1a4fb09994e4b7feae2edb)
-   [**pom.xml file**](#06b881fb4c044882b615cbab73367095)

1.  Right-click the C-App project and select **Export Composite
    Application Project** from the pop-up menu.  
    Example:  
    ![](/assets/img/tutorials/119132413/119132419.png){width="500" height="332"}
2.  Define the location you want to generate the CAR file by clicking
    the Browse next to **Export Destination** and click **Next** .
3.  Select the artifact that needs to be included into the CAR file and
    click **Finish** .

        !!! tip
    
        **Tip** : When you create a CAR file with artifacts, ensure that
        each artifact name is the same as the relevant artifact file name.
    

Now you see the `             .car            ` file created in the
defined location.

1.  Open the `              pom.xml             ` file of the C-App
    project in the Composite Application Project POM Editor.
2.  Select the artifact that needs to be included into the CAR file.
3.  Click ![](/assets/img/tutorials/119132413/119132433.png){width="30"} and
    define the location you want to create the CAR file.

Now you see the .car file created in the defined location.

You have now exported all your project's artifacts into a single CAR
file. Next, you need to deploy the Composite Application in the server.

!!! note

Note

-   In a CAR file, if a particular artifact name is different from the
    relevant artifact file name, re-deploying the CAR file fails with an
    error.
-   If a CAR file has one or more artifacts that are named differently
    from the relevant artifact file name, you are unable to remove those
    artifacts from memory when you delete the CAR file.
-->

### Step 4: Build and run the artifacts

To test the artifacts, deploy the [packaged artifacts](#step-3-package-the-artifacts) in the embedded Micro Integrator:

1.  Right-click the composite application project and click **Export Project Artifacts and Run**.
2.  In the dialog that opens, select the composite application project that you want to deploy.  
4.  Click **Finish**. The artifacts will be deployed in the embedded Micro Integrator and the server will start. See the startup log in the **Console** tab.

### Step 5: Test the use case

Let's test the use case by sending a simple client request that invokes the service.

#### Start the back-end service

1. Download the JAR file of the back-end service from [here](https://github.com/wso2-docs/WSO2_EI/blob/master/Back-End-Service/Hospital-Service-2.0.0-EI7.jar).
2. Open a terminal, navigate to the location where your saved the [back-end service](#step-1-set-up-the-workspace).
3. Execute the following command to start the service:

    ```bash
    java -jar Hospital-Service-2.0.0-EI7.jar
    ```

#### Send the client request

Let's use the **CLI Tool** to find the URL of the REST API that is deployed in the Micro Integrator:

1.  Open a terminal and navigate to the `CLI_HOME/bin` directory.
2.  Execute the following command to start the tool:
    `./mi`
3.  Execute the following command to find the APIs deployed in the server:
    `mi api show`
    
    Note: Please remember to login to CLI using `mi remote login` command giving `admin` as both username and 
    password before executing the above command.

Now, open a command line terminal and enter the following request: 

```bash
curl -v http://localhost:8290/healthcare/querydoctor/surgery
```

!!! Info
    - The above request is formed as per the **URI-Template** (`http://:/healthcare/{uri.var.category}`) defined when creating the endpoint. 
    - The `{uri.var.category}` is also specified in the **URI-Template** (`http://<host>:<port>/querydoctor/{category}`)
    - Other categories you can try sending in the request are: `cardiology`,  `gynaecology`, `ent`, and `paediatric`.

#### Analyze the response

You will see the response message from the HealthcareService with a list of available doctors and the relevant details.

```json
[
  {"name":"thomas collins",
  "hospital":"grand oak community hospital",
  "category":"surgery",
  "availability":"9.00 a.m - 11.00 a.m",
  "fee":7000.0},
  {"name":"anne clement",
   "hospital":"clemency medical center",
   "category":"surgery",
   "availability":"8.00 a.m - 10.00 a.m",
   "fee":12000.0},
  {"name":"seth mears",
   "hospital":"pine valley community hospital",
   "category":"surgery",
   "availability":"3.00 p.m - 5.00 p.m",
   "fee":8000.0}
]
```

Now, check the **Console** tab of WSO2 Integration Studio and you will see the following message:
`INFO - LogMediator message = "Welcome to HealthcareService"`

You have now created and deployed an API resource in the Micro Integrator, which receives requests, logs a message using the Log mediator, sends the request to a back-end service using the Send mediator, and returns a response to the requesting client.
