# Using the HTTP Inbound Endpoint
This sample demonstrates how an HTTP inbound endpoint can act as a
dynamic http listener. Many http listeners can be added without
restarting the server. When a message arrives at a port it will bypass
the inbound side axis2 layer and will be sent directly to the sequence
for mediation.The response also behaves in the same way.

## Synapse configuration

Following are the integration artifacts that we can used to implement this scenario. See the instructions on how to [build and run](#build-and-run) this example.

```xml tab='Inbound Endpoint'
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<inboundEndpoint xmlns="http://ws.apache.org/ns/synapse"
                name="HttpListenerEP1"
                sequence="TestIn"
                onError="fault"
                protocol="http"
                suspend="false">
   <parameters>
    <parameter name="inbound.http.port">8085</parameter>
   </parameters>
</inboundEndpoint>
```

```xml tab='Sequence'
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<sequence xmlns="http://ws.apache.org/ns/synapse" name="TestIn">
    <send receive="reciveSeq">
        <endpoint>
            <address uri="http://localhost:9000/services/SimpleStockQuoteService"/>
        </endpoint>
    </send>
</sequence>
<sequence xmlns="http://ws.apache.org/ns/synapse" name="reciveSeq">
    <send/>
</sequence>
```
## Build and run

Create the artifacts:

1. [Set up WSO2 Integration Studio](../../../../develop/installing-WSO2-Integration-Studio).
2. [Create an ESB Solution project](../../../../develop/creating-projects/#esb-config-project)
3. Create a [mediation sequence](../../../../develop/creating-artifacts/creating-reusable-sequences) and [inbound endpoint](../../../../develop/creating-artifacts/creating-an-inbound-endpoint) with configurations given in the above example.
4. [Deploy the artifacts](../../../../develop/deploy-and-run) in your Micro Integrator.

Set up a back-end service for the sample.

Invoke the inbound endpoint.

Analyze the output debug messages for the actions in the dumb client mode. You will see that the Micro Integrator receives a message when the Micro Integrator Inbound is set as the ultimate receiver. You will also see the response from the back
end in the client.
