# WSO2 Micro Integrator vs WSO2 EI 6.x.x Family (ESB Profile)

[WSO2 Enterprise Integrator](https://wso2.com/integration/micro-integrator/) consists of two product families:

-	WSO2 EI 7.x.x family
-	WSO2 EI 6.x.x family

[WSO2 EI 6.5.0](https://docs.wso2.com/display/EI650/WSO2+Enterprise+Integrator+Documentation) is the latest release of the 6.x.x family, which includes the **ESB profile** and other supporting profiles. This WSO2 EI product family offers the conventional, centralized integration solution of the WSO2 middleware stack. 

The new [WSO2 Enterprise Integrator (WSO2 EI 7.0.0)](https://ei.docs.wso2.com/en/latest/) is a hybrid platform that enables API-centric integration supporting various integration architecture styles: MSAs, cloud-native architectures, or a centralized ESB architecture.  This integration platform offers the choice between code-driven and graphical/configuration-driven approaches to integration development. 

The **[Micro Integrator](../../overview/introduction)** is exclusively the configuration-driven/graphical-tooling approach to integration development in the EI 7.0.0 family.

## Advantages of using the Micro Integrator

Compared to the ESB profile of WSO2 Enterprise Integrator 6.x.x, the Micro Integrator encompasses the following key attributes that are essential for a microservice-ready integration solution.

-	Faster startup time (<3s).
-	Low memory footprint.
-	Stateless services.
-	Immutable services.
-	Native Kubernetes support with the integration operator. 
-	Lightweight, container-native, and supports distributed deployments.
