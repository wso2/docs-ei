# Call Mediator

The **Call mediator** is used to send messages out of the Micro Integrator to an **endpoint**. You can invoke services either in blocking or non-blocking manner.

When you invoke a service in non-blocking mode, the underlying worker
thread returns without waiting for the response. In blocking mode, the
underlying worker thread gets blocked and waits for the response after
sending the request to the endpoint. Call mediator in blocking mode is
very much similar to the [Callout mediator](callout-Mediator.md).

In both blocking and non-blocking modes, Call mediator behaves in a synchronous manner. Hence, mediation pauses after the service invocation, and resumes from the next mediator in the sequence when the response is received. Call mediator allows you to create your configuration independent from the underlying architecture.

Non-blocking mode of the Call mediator leverages the non-blocking transports for better performance. Therefore, it is recommended to use it in non-blocking mode as much as possible. However, there are scenarios where you need to use the blocking mode. For example, when you implement a scenario related to JMS transactions, it is vital to use the underlying threads in blocking mode.

You can obtain the service endpoint for the Call mediator as follows:

-   Pick from message-level information
-   Pick from a pre-defined endpoint

If you do not specify an endpoint, the Call mediator tries to send the
message using the `         WSA:TO        ` address of the message. If
you specify an endpoint, the Call mediator sends the message based on
the specified endpoint.

The endpoint type can be Leaf Endpoint (i.e. Address/WSDL/Default/HTTP)
or Group Endpoint (i.e. Failover/Load balance/Recipient list). Group
Endpoint is only supported in non-blocking mode.

!!! Info
    The Call mediator is a [content-unaware](../../../references/mediators/about-mediators/#classification-of-mediators) mediator.

## Enabling mutual SSL in the blocking mode

When using the Call mediator in the **blocking mode** (blocking=true), enable the mediator to handle mutual SSL by adding the following JVM settings to the `MI_HOME/bin/micro-integrator.sh` file:

``` java
-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore="$CARBON_HOME/repository/resources/security/wso2carbon.jks" \
-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword="wso2carbon" \
-Djavax.net.ssl.keyPassword="wso2carbon" \
-Drampart.axiom.parser.pool=false \
```

## Syntax

``` java
<call [blocking="true"] />
```

If the message is to be sent to one or more endpoints, use the following syntax:

``` java
<call [blocking="true"]>
   (endpointref | endpoint)+
</call>
```

-   The `          endpointref         ` token refers to the following:
    ``` java
    <endpoint key="name"/>
    ```

-   The `          endpoint         ` token refers to an anonymous
    endpoint definition.

## Configuration

Select one of the following options to define the endpoint to which the message should be delivered.

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Parameter Name</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>None</strong></td>
<td>Select this option if you do not want to provide an endpoint. The Call mediator will send the message using its <code>             wsa:to            </code> address.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Define Inline</strong></td>
<td>If this is selected, the endpoint to which the message should be sent can be included within the Call mediator configuration. Click <strong>Add</strong> to add the required endpoint. For more information on Adding an endpoint, see <a href="../../develop/creating-artifacts/creating-endpoints">Adding an Endpoint</a> .</td>

## Example

### Example 1 - Service orchestration

In this example, the Call mediator invokes a backend service. An [Enrich mediator](enrich-Mediator.md) stores the response received for
that service invocation.

The [Filter Mediator](filter-Mediator.md) added after the Call mediator
carries out a filter to determine whether the first call has been
successful. If it is successful, second backend service is invoked. The
payload of the request to the second backend is the response of the
first service invocation .

After a successful second backend service invocation, response of the
first service is retrieved by the [Enrich mediator](enrich-Mediator.md)
from the property where it was formerly stored. This response is sent to
the client by the [Respond mediator](respond-Mediator.md) .

If it is not successful, a custom JSON error message is sent with HTTP
500. If the first call itself is not successful, the output is just sent
back with the relevant error code.

``` xml

      <inSequence>
         <log/>
         <call>
            <endpoint>

                        <target type="body"/>
                     </enrich>
                     <respond/>
                  </then>
                  <else>

                        <property name="switchlog" value="Case: second call unsuccessful"/>
                     </log>
                     <property name="HTTP_SC" value="500" scope="axis2"/>
                     <payloadFactory media-type="json">
                        <format>{ "status": "ERROR!"}</format>
                        <args/>
                     </payloadFactory>
                     <respond/>
                  </else>
               </filter>
            </then>
            <else>
               <log level="custom">
                  <property name="switchlog" value="Case: first call unsuccessful"/>
               </log>
               <respond/>
            </else>
         </filter>
      </inSequence>
   </target>
```

### Example 2 - Continuing mediation without waiting for responses

In this example, the message will be cloned by the [Clone Mediator](clone-Mediator.md) and sent via the Call mediator. The Drop mediator drops the response so that no further mediation is carried out for the cloned message. However, since the `         continueParent        ` attribute of the [Clone mediator](clone-Mediator.md) is set to `         true        ` , the original message is mediated in parallel. Therefore, the [Log Mediator](log-Mediator.md) at the end of the configuration will log the `         After call mediator        ` log message without waiting for
the Call mediator response.

``` xml
...
<log level="full"/>
<clone continueParent="true">
<target>
<sequence>
<call>
<endpoint>
<address uri="http://localhost:8080/echoString"/>
</endpoint>
</call>
<drop/>
</sequence>
</target>
</clone>
<log level="custom">
<property name="MESSAGE" value="After call mediator"/>
</log>
...
```

### Example 3 - Call mediator in blocking mode

In the following sample configuration, the [Header Mediator](header-Mediator.md) is used to add the action, the [PayloadFactory Mediator](payloadFactory-Mediator.md) is used to store the the request message and the Call mediator is used to invoke a backend service. You will see that the payload of the request and header action are sent to the backend. After successful backend service invocation, you will see that the response of the service is retrieved by the Micro Integrator and sent to the client as the response using the [Respond Mediator](respond-Mediator.md).

```
<target>
   <inSequence>
      <header name="Action" value="urn:getQuote" />
      <payloadFactory media-type="xml">
         <format>
            <m0:getQuote xmlns:m0="http://services.samples">
               <m0:request>
                  <m0:symbol>WSO2</m0:symbol>
               </m0:request>
            </m0:getQuote>
         </format>
         <args />
      </payloadFactory>
      <call blocking="true">
         <endpoint>
            <address uri="http://localhost:9000/services/SimpleStockQuoteService" />
         </endpoint>
      </call>
      <respond />
   </inSequence>
</target>
```

### Example 4 - Receiving response headers in blocking mode

If you want to receive the response message headers, when you use the Call mediator in blocking mode, add the `BLOCKING_SENDER_PRESERVE_REQ_HEADERS` property within the proxy service, or in a sequence as shown in the sample proxy configuration below.

!!! Info
    Set the value of the `BLOCKING_SENDER_PRESERVE_REQ_HEADERS` property to `false` to receive the response message headers. If you set it to `true`, you cannot get the response headers, but the request headers will be preserved.

```
<proxy xmlns="http://ws.apache.org/ns/synapse"
       name="sample"
       transports="https"
       statistics="enable"
       trace="enable"
       startOnLoad="true">
   <target>
      <inSequence>
         <property name="FORCE_ERROR_ON_SOAP_FAULT"
                   value="true"
                   scope="default"
                   type="STRING"/>
         <property name="HTTP_METHOD" value="POST" scope="axis2" type="STRING"/>
         <property name="messageType" value="text/xml" scope="axis2" type="STRING"/>
         <property name="BLOCKING_SENDER_PRESERVE_REQ_HEADERS" value="false"/>
         <call blocking="true">
            <endpoint>
               <address uri="https://localhost:8243/services/sampleBE"
                        trace="enable"
                        statistics="enable"/>
            </endpoint>
         </call>
         
      </inSequence>
      <outSequence/>
   </target>
   <description/>
</proxy>
```
