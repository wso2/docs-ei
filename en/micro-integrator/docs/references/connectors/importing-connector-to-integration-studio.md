2. Right click on the project that you created and click on **Add or Remove Connector** -> **Add Connector**. You will get directed to the WSO2 Connector Store.

3. Search for the specific connector and download it to the workspace. In this case, Salesforce is used as an example, but you can do this for the connector you require for your integration scenario. <br>

4. Click **Finish**, and your Integration Project is ready. The downloaded connector is displayed on the left side palette with its operations.
