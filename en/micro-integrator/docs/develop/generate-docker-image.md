# Generating Docker images

See the topics given below.

## Before you begin

1.  Install Docker from the [Docker Site](https://docs.docker.com/) .
2.  Create a Docker Account at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) and log in.
3.  Start the Docker server.

## Generate the Docker image

1.  Open WSO2 Integration Studio.
2.  Open an existing project. Right-click on **Composite Project** and
    then click **Generate Docker Image**.  
    ![Create docker](../assets/img/create_project/open-docker_image_generation_wizard.png) 

    The **WSO2 Platform Distribution - Generate Docker Image** wizard
    opens.
    
3.  Enter information in the wizard as follows:

    1.  In the **Generate Docker Image** page, enter the following
        details:  
        ![Create docker image dialog](../assets/img/create_project/generate_docker_image_dialog.png) 

        -   **Name of the application** : The name of the composite
            application with the artifacts created for your ESB project.
            The name of the ESB project is displayed by default, but it
            can be changed if required.
        -   **Application version** : The version of the composite
            application.
        -   **Name of the Docker Image** : A name for the Docker image.
        -   **Docker Image Tag** : A tag for the Docker image to be used
            for reference. This is optional.
        -   **Export Destination** : Browse for the preferred location
            in your machine to export the Docker image.

    2.  Once you have entered the required details, click **Next**.
    3.  In the next page, select the ESB projects that you want to
        include in the Docker image and click **Finish** .  
        ![Create docker image](../assets/img/create_project/select_artifact_docker.png)  
        Once the Docker image is successfully created, a message similar
        to the following appears in your screen.  
        ![Create docker image](../assets/img/create_project/docker_image_successful.png)
