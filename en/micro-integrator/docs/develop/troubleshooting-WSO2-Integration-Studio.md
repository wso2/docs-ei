## Restoring the project perspective

If your project view goes missing, you can get it back by navigating
to **Window -> Perspective -> Reset Perspective** from the toolbar.

If you need to open a particular project view, you can get it by
navigating to **Window -> Show View -> Other...** from the
toolbar, and open the preferred view from the list.
