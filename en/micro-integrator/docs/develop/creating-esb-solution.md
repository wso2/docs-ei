# Creating a Project Solution

An ESB solution consists of one or several project directories. These directories store the various ESB artifacts that you create for your integration sequence. This solution allows you to create all the project directories that are required for your integration solution using one wizard.

Follow the steps given below.

1.  Open **WSO2 Integration Studio** and click **ESB Project â†’ Create New** in the **Getting Started** view as shown below.
