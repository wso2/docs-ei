# JMX Monitoring

Java Management Extensions (JMX) is a technology that lets you implement management interfaces for Java applications. A management interface, as defined by JMX is composed of named objects called MBeans (Management Beans). MBeans are registered with a name (an ObjectName) in an MBeanServer. To manage a resource or many resources in your application, you can write an MBean defining its management interface and register that MBean in your MBeanServer. The content of the MBeanServer can then be exposed through various protocols, implemented by protocol connectors, or protocol adaptors.

## Configuring JMX in WSO2 Micro Integrator

JMX is enabled in WSO2 products by default, which ensures that the JMX server starts automatically when you start the product. Additionally, you can enable JMX separately for the various datasources that are used by the product. Once JMX is enabled, you can monitor your product using [**JConsole**](#monitoring-with-jconsole).

<!--
Configuring JMX ports for the server
The default JMX ports (RMIRegistryPort and the RMIServerPort) are
configured in the `deployment.toml ` file (stored in the
`         <MI_HOME>/conf        ` directory) as shown
below. If required, you can update these default values.

```toml
[monitoring.jmx]
rmi_hostname = localhost
rmi_registry_port = 9999
rmi_server_port = 11111
```
-->

<!--
Disabling JMX for the server
To disable JMX for the server, update the following configuration in the deployment.toml file:
```toml
[monitoring.jmx]
rmi_server_start = true
```
Enabling JMX for a datasource
To enable JMX for a datasource, add the following configuration in the deployment.toml file:
```toml
[[datasource]]
jmx_enable = true
```
-->

## Monitoring with JConsole

Jconsole is a JMX-compliant monitoring tool, which comes with the Java
Development Kit (JDK) 1.5 and newer versions. You can find this tool
inside your `         <JDK_HOME>/bin        ` directory.

### Starting WSO2 Micro Integrator with JMX

First, [start the product](../../setup/installation/install_in_vm/#running-the-micro-integrator).  

!!! Info
    If [JMX is enabled](#configuring-jmx-in-wso2-micro-integrator), the **JMX server URL**  would be:    
    ``` java
    service:jmx:rmi://<your-ip>:11111/jndi/rmi://<your-ip>:9999/jmxrmi
    ```
### Starting JConsole
        
Once the product server is started, you can start the `JConsole` tool as follows:

1.  Open a command prompt and navigate to the `<JDK_HOME>/bin` directory.
2.  Execute the `jconsole` command to open the log-in screen of the **Java Monitoring & Management Console** as
    shown below.  
    ![jconsole connection](../assets/img/jmx/jconsole-new-connection.png)
3.  Enter the connection details in the above screen as follows:
    1.  Enter the **JMX server URL** in the **Remote Process** field. This URL is published on the command prompt when you start the
        server as explained [above](#starting-wso2-micro-integrator-with-jmx).
        !!! Info
            If you are connecting with a remote IP address instead of localhost, you need to bind the JMX service to the externally accessible IP address by adding the following system property to the product startup script stored in the `MI_HOME>/bin` directory (`micro-integrator.sh` for Linux and `micro-integrator.bat` for Windows). For more information, read [Troubleshooting Connection Problems in JConsole](https://blogs.oracle.com/jmxetc/entrytroubleshooting_connection_problems_in_jconsole).
            ``` java
            -Djava.rmi.server.hostname=<IP_ADDRESS_WHICH_YOU_USE_TO_CONNECT_TO_SERVER>
            ```
            Be sure to restart the server after adding the above property.

    2.  Enter values for the **Username** and **Password** fields to log in. If you are logging in as the administrator, you can use the. same administrator account that is used to log in to the product server: admin/admin.        

4.  Click **Connect** to open the **Java Monitoring & Management Console**. See the **Oracle** documentation on [using
    JConsole](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/management/jconsole.html). The following tabs will be available:  

    -   **Overview**
        ![jconsole overview](../assets/img/jmx/jconsole-overview.png)
    -   **Memory**
        ![jconsole memory](../assets/img/jmx/jconsole-memory.png)
    -   **Threads**
        ![jconsole threads](../assets/img/jmx/jconsole-threads.png)
    -   **Classes**
        ![jconsole classes](../assets/img/jmx/jconsole-classes.png)
    -   **VM**
        ![jconsole VM](../assets/img/jmx/jconsole-vm-summary.png)
    -   **MBeans**
        ![jconsole MBeans](../assets/img/jmx/jconsole-mbeans.png)

See the list of [WSO2 Micro Integrator MBeans](#mbeans-for-wso2-micro-integrator) that you can monitor.

## Monitoring WSO2 Micro Integrator with Jolokia

[Jolokia](https://jolokia.org) is a JMX-HTTP bridge, which is an
alternative to JSR-160 connectors. It is an agent-based approach that
supports many platforms. In addition to basic JMX operations, it
enhances JMX monitoring with unique features like bulk requests and
fine-grained security policies.

Follow the steps below to use Jolokia to monitor a WSO2 product.

1.  Download [Jolokia OSGi Agent](https://jolokia.org/download.html). These instructions are tested with the Jolokia OSGI Agent version 1.3.6 by downloading the `jolokia-osgi-1.3.6.jar` file.
2.  Add it to the `MI_HOME/dropins/` directory.
3.  Start WSO2 Micro Integrator.

Once the server starts, you can read MBeans using Jolokia APIs.
Following are a few examples.

-   List all available MBeans: <http://localhost:9763/jolokia/list>
    (Change the appropriate hostname and port accordingly.)
-   WSO2 Micro Integrator MBean:
    <http://localhost:9763/jolokia/read/org.apache.synapse:Name=https-sender,Type=PassThroughConnections/ActiveConnections>
-   Reading Heap Memory:
    <http://localhost:9763/jolokia/read/java.lang:type=Memory/HeapMemoryUsage>

## MBeans for WSO2 Micro Integrator

When JMX is enabled, WSO2 Micro Integrator exposes a number of management resources as
JMX Management Beans (MBeans) that can be used for managing and
monitoring the running server.  When you start JConsole, you can monitor
these MBeans from the **MBeans** tab. While some of these MBeans (
**ServerAdmin** and **DataSource** ) are common to all WSO2 products,
some MBeans are specific to WSO2 Micro Integrator.

![micro integrator mbeans](../assets/img/jmx/mi-mbeans.png)

The following section summarizes the common MBeans for all WSO2 products:

### Transport MBeans

For each transport listener and sender enabled in WSO2 Micro Integrator, there will be
an MBean under the `         org.apache.axis2/Transport        ` domain.
For example, when the JMS transport is enabled, the following MBean will
be exposed:

-   `          org.apache.axis2/Transport/jms-sender-                     n                   `

You can also view the following Transport MBeans:

-   `          org.apache.synapse/Transport/passthru-http-receiver         `
-   `          org.apache.synapse/Transport/passthru-http-sender         `
-   `          org.apache.synapse/Transport/passthru-https-receiver         `
-   `          org.apache.synapse/Transport/passthru-https-sender         `

## Disabling the JMX thread view

Dumping JMX threads is an expensive operation that affects the CPU
consumption when many threads are being processed at the same time.

WSO2 Micro Integrator has enabled thread dumping by default. Therefore, to avoid
dumping all the threads
[here](https://github.com/wso2/wso2-synapse/blob/master/modules/commons/src/main/java/org/apache/synapse/commons/jmx/ThreadingView.java#L268), you can configure the property given below.

!!! Info
    It is recommended not to dump the thread especially when you have enabled analytics in a production environment.

1.  Open the `MI_HOME/conf/deployment.toml` file.
2.  Add the following property to the file and save the file.
    ```toml
    [synapse_properties]
    'synapse.jmx.thread.view.enabled'=false
    ```
