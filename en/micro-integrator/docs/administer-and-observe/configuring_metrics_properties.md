# Configuring Metrics Properties

When the [monitoring capability with metrics is
enabled](_Enabling_Metrics_and_Storage_Types_) in your product, the
metrics dashboard will be available when you log into the management
console. The metrics dashboard will provide a page for viewing the
statistics that use JVM metrics. Further, depending on the WSO2 product
that you are using, there will be a separate page for viewing
product-specific statistics using metrics.

The `         <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/conf/metrics.properties        `
file specifies the properties that correspond to the gauges for JVM
metrics in the metrics dashboard. The level defined for a property in
this file determines the extent to which the relevant gauge in the
dashboard should be updated with information. The different levels that
can be defined for properties are as follows:

| Level     | Description                                                                                                    |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Off**   | Designates no informational events.                                                                            |
| **Info**  | Designates informational metric events that highlight the progress of the application at coarse-grained level. |
| **Debug** | Designates fine-grained informational events that are most useful to debug an application.                     |
| **Trace** | Designates finer-grained informational events than the DEBUG.                                                  |
| **All**   | Designates all the informational events.                                                                       |

If no specific level is configured for a property in the
`         metrics.properties        ` file, the metrics root level will
apply. The root level is defined as shown in the following example in
the `         metrics.properties        ` file.

``` java
    metrics.rootLevel=OFF
```

If you want to change the current root level, you can also use the
following command.

``` java
    -Dmetrics.rootLevel=INFO
```

The levels in the `         metrics.properties        ` file can be
configured to any hierarchy. However, if the level defined for an
individual property is different to the level defined for its parent in
the hierarchy, the level defined for the individual property will
overrule that of the parent. For example, if we have
`         metric.level.jvm.memory=INFO        ` in the
`         <PRODUCT_HOME>/repository/conf/metrics.properties        `
file, all metrics under `         jvm.memory        ` will have
`         INFO        ` as the configured level. However, if you have
`         metric.level.jvm.memory.heap=TRACE        ` , the
`         TRACE        ` level would apply for the
`         metric.level.jvm.memory.heap        ` property even though it
is a child property of `         jvm.memory.        `
