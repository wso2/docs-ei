# Using Messaging Metrics

Messaging metrics are the Java metrics enabled in the WSO2 Message
Broker (MB) or the Broker Profile of WSO2 EI for the purpose of
monitoring broker-specific statistics.

!!! note

The metrics feature is enabled in the broker by default. See the topic
on [setting up WSO2 Carbon metrics](_Setting_Up_Carbon_Metrics_) for
details on how metrics are enabled.


Follow the steps given below for instructions on using the **Messaging
Metrics** dashboard.

1.  Log in to the management console of the broker and click **Monitor
    -\> Metrics -\> Messaging Metrics** .

3.  First, select the **Source** from the drop-down list. In a clustered
    setup, you must specify the broker node that you want to monitor.
4.  You can specify the time interval for which the statistics displayed
    are valid. By default, you will see statistics from the last 5
    minutes.
5.  In the **Views** section, you will find buttons corresponding to the
    different types of metrics that you want to view. You can click the
    relevant button to view the statistics. Given below are the
    statistics corresponding to each button:
