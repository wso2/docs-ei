# Introduction

WSO2 Enterprise Integrator (EI) 7.0 includes a Ballerina Integrator, which is a powerful code-based approach to integration. 

For developers, the Ballerina-based integration component marks a new phase of integration technology - a powerful, simple-to-learn, code-driven approach to programming integrations. It includes first-class cloud-native functions as well as a graphical sequence diagram tool. Since it is a programming language, integration developers can apply agile methodologies, truly bringing a new degree of speed and agility to integration projects. 

The following image is an illustration of what Ballerina Integrator consists of and the various components that work together to solve an integration problem.
