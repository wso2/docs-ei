Ballerina is an open-source programming language that empowers developers to integrate their system easily with the support of connectors.

This tutorial demonstrates a scenario where Ballerina is used to call a SOAP backend. Here, a SOAP backend is fronted by a Ballerina service that accepts a REST request and converts it to a SOAP request. The SOAP connector is used to call the SOAP backend.

## What you'll build

We create a service `stockQuote` that fronts a SOAP backend. The service has two resources `getQuote` and `placeOrder`, which calls respectively the relevant services from the SOAP backend. The response received from the backend is finally sent back to the client.

## Get the code

Pull the module from [Ballerina Central](https://central.ballerina.io/) using the following command.

```bash
ballerina pull wso2/stockquote_service
```

Alternately, you can download the ZIP file and extract the contents to get the code.

## Implementation

* Create a new Ballerina project named `rest-to-soap-service`.
    ```bash
    $ ballerina new rest-to-soap-service
    ```

* Navigate to the rest-to-soap-service directory.

* Add a new module named `stockquote_service` to the project.

    ```bash
    $ ballerina add stockquote_service
    ```

* Open the project with VS Code. The project structure will be similar to the following.

    ```shell
    .
    ├── Ballerina.toml
    └── src
        └── stockquote_service
            ├── main.bal
            ├── Module.md
            ├── resources
            └── tests
                ├── main_test.bal
                └── resources
    ```

    We can remove the file `main_test.bal` for the moment, since we are not writing any tests for our service.

First let's create a mock SOAP service. Please note that Ballerina does not support writing SOAP services. Therefore, we're creating mock service that would mimic SOAP responses.

* Create a file named `mock_soap_service.bal` under `stockquote_service` with the following content.

**mock_soap_service.bal**

```ballerina
import ballerina/http;

@http:ServiceConfig {
    basePath: "/services"
}
service services on new http:Listener(9000) {
    @http:ResourceConfig {
        methods: ["GET", "POST"],
        path: "/SimpleStockQuoteService"
    }
    resource function SimpleStockQuoteService(http:Caller caller, http:Request request) {
        string soapAction = request.getHeader("SOAPAction");
        xml requestPayload = checkpanic request.getXmlPayload();
        string company = requestPayload.Body.symbol.getTextValue();
        http:Response response = new; 
        match soapAction {
            "urn:getQuote" => {
                response.setXmlPayload(<@untainted> getQuote(company));                
            }
            "urn:placeOrder" => {
                response.setXmlPayload(<@untainted> placeOrder());
            }
            _ => {
                response.statusCode = http:STATUS_BAD_REQUEST;
                response.setTextPayload("Unsupported Action!!!");
            }
        }
        error? respond = caller->respond(response);
    }
}

function getQuote(string company) returns xml {
    xmlns "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" as soapenv;
    xmlns "http://services.samples" as ns;

                                        </ns:getQuoteResponse>
                                    </soapenv:Body>
                                </soapenv:Envelope>`;

    return responsePayload;
}

function placeOrder() returns xml {
    xmlns "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" as soapenv;
    xmlns "http://services.samples" as ns;
    xmlns "http://services.samples/xsd" as ax21;
    xml responsePayload = xml `<soapenv:Envelope>
                                    <soapenv:Body>
                                        <ns:placeOrderResponse>
                                                <ax21:status>created</ax21:status>
                                        </ns:placeOrderResponse>
                                    </soapenv:Body>
                                </soapenv:Envelope>`;
    return responsePayload;
}
```

This service checks the SOAPAction header in the request, calls the relevant method, and responds with a SOAP envelope.

* Now let's open the `main.bal` file and add the following content. This is going to be our integration logic.

**main.bal**

```ballerina
import ballerina/http;
import ballerina/jsonutils;
import wso2/soap;

soap:Soap11Client soapEP = new("http://localhost:9000/services/SimpleStockQuoteService");

@http:ServiceConfig {
    basePath: "/stockQuote"
}
service stockQuote on new http:Listener(9090) {
    @http:ResourceConfig {
        methods: ["GET"],
        path: "/quote/{symbol}"
    }
    resource function getQuote(http:Caller caller, http:Request request, string symbol) {
        xmlns "http://services.samples" as m0; 
        xml payload = xml `<m0:symbol>${symbol}</m0:symbol>`; 
        soap:SoapResponse soapResponse = checkpanic soapEP->sendReceive("urn:getQuote", payload); 
        xml responsePayload = checkpanic soapResponse.httpResponse.getXmlPayload(); 
        http:Response response = new;
        response.setJsonPayload(<@untainted>checkpanic jsonutils:fromXML(responsePayload.Body.getQuoteResponse,
            {preserveNamespaces: false}));        
        error? respond = caller->respond(response);
    }

    @http:ResourceConfig {
        methods: ["POST"],
        path: "/order"
    }
    resource function placeOrder(http:Caller caller, http:Request request) {
        json orderReq = checkpanic request.getJsonPayload();
        string price = orderReq.price != null ? orderReq.price.toString() : "";
        string quantity = orderReq.quantity != null ? orderReq.quantity.toString() : "";
        string symbol = orderReq.symbol != null ? orderReq.symbol.toString() : "";
        xmlns "http://services.samples" as m;
        xml payload = xml `<m:placeOrder>
                                <m:order>
                                    <m:price>${price}</m:price>
                                    <m:quantity>${quantity}</m:quantity>
                                    <m:symbol>${symbol}</m:symbol>
                                </m:order>
                            </m:placeOrder>`;
        soap:SoapResponse soapResponse = checkpanic soapEP->sendReceive("urn:placeOrder", <@untainted> payload); 
        xml responsePayload = checkpanic soapResponse.httpResponse.getXmlPayload(); 
        http:Response response = new;
        response.setJsonPayload(<@untainted>checkpanic jsonutils:fromXML(responsePayload.Body.placeOrderResponse,
            {preserveNamespaces: false}));
        error? respond = caller->respond(<@untainted> response);
    }
}
```

Here we create a SOAP client with the mock SOAP service we created earlier. There are two resources in the service - `getQuote` and `placeOrder`. In the `getQuote` resource, we construct an XML payload with the path parameter `company` and pass the payload to the SOAP client. Then we receive the response, convert it to JSON and respond back to the client. The resource `placeOrder` also has a similar logic except the XML payload is constructed from the values in the request payload.

## Testing

* First let’s build the module. While being in the exposing-soap-service directory, execute the following command.

    ```bash
    $ ballerina build stockquote_service
    ```

This creates the executables.

* Now run the .jar file created in the above step.

    ```bash
    $ java -jar target/bin/stockquote_service.jar
    ```

Now we can see that two services have started on ports 9000 and 9090. 

* Let’s access the `stockQuote` service's `getQuote` resource by executing the following curl command.

    ```bash
    $ curl http://localhost:9090/stockQuote/quote/xyz
    ```

    We receive a JSON payload similar to the following.

    ```json
    {  
    "getQuoteResponse":{  
        "change":"-2.86843917118114",
        "earnings":"-8.540305401672558",
        "high":"-176.67958828498735",
        "last":"177.66987465262923",
        "low":"-176.30898912339075",
        "marketCap":"5.649557998178506E7",
        "name":"xyz Company",
        "open":"185.62740369461244",
        "peRatio":"24.341353665128693",
        "percentageChange":"-1.4930577008849097",
        "prevClose":"192.11844053187397",
        "symbol":"xyz",
        "volume":"7791"
    }
    }
    ```

* Now let's access the `placeOrder` resource by executing the following curl command.

    ```bash
    $ curl http://localhost:9090/stockQuote/order -H 'Content-Type:application/json' --data '{"price":"1000.00", "quantity":"2", "symbol":"abc"}'
    ```

    We receive a JSON payload similar to the following.

    ```json
    {
        "placeOrderResponse":{
            "status":"created"
        }
    }
    ```
