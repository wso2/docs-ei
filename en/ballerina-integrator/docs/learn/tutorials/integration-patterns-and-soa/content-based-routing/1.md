Content-based routing is an integration pattern where the message received from a client is routed to different channels/paths/endpoints based on the content of the message. This guide demonstrates a simple content-based routing scenario where, based on the company name provided in the request, the relevant company’s service endpoint is called to get the stock quote.

## What you'll build

We create a service called `stockQuote` that accepts an HTTP request from a client. The client appends as a query parameter in the request; i.e., the company name of which he wants to know the price of the stock. The `stockQuote` service identifies the company, routes the request to the relevant company’s stock quote service, obtains the response from the company’s service and returns the response to the client. If the company name is not available in the request, the service will simply respond with a 400 - Bad Request.

## Before you begin
 
* Download [Ballerina Integrator](https://wso2.com/integration/ballerina-integrator/) for your operating system
* Install Oracle JDK 1.8.*
* Install a Text Editor or an IDE 
  > **Tip**: For a better development experience, use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) (which is the recommended editor for Ballerina Integrator) and install the [Ballerina Integrator Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WSO2.ballerina-integrator).

## Get the code

Pull the module from [Ballerina Central](https://central.ballerina.io/) using the following command.

```bash
ballerina pull wso2/content_based_routing
```

Alternately, you can download the ZIP file and extract the contents to get the code.

## Implementation

* Create a new Ballerina project named `content-based-routing`.

```bash
$ ballerina new content-based-routing
```

* Navigate to the content-based-routing directory.

* Add a new module named `content_based_routing` to the project.

```bash
$ ballerina add content_based_routing
```

* Open the project with VS Code. The project structure will be similar to the following.

```shell
content-based-routing
├── Ballerina.toml
└── src
    └── content_based_routing
        ├── main.bal
        ├── Module.md
        ├── resources
        └── tests
            ├── main_test.bal
            └── resources
```

We can remove the file `main_test.bal` for the moment, since we are not writing any tests for our service.

First let's create the services that we will use as backend endpoints.

* Create a new file named `abcService.bal` file under `content_based_routing` with the following content.

**abcService.bal**

```ballerina
import ballerina/http;

@http:ServiceConfig {
    basePath: "/abc"
}
service abc on new http:Listener(8081) {
    @http:ResourceConfig {
        methods: ["GET"],
        path: "quote"
    }
    resource function quote(http:Caller caller, http:Request request) {
        http:Response response = new;
        response.setTextPayload("10000.00");
        error? respond = caller->respond(response);
    }
}
```

This is simply a service that will run on port 8081 responding a text payload `10000.00`.

* Likewise, let's create another file `xyzService.bal` with the following content.

**xyzService.bal**

```ballerina
import ballerina/http;

@http:ServiceConfig {
    basePath: "/xyz"
}
service xyz on new http:Listener(8082) {
    @http:ResourceConfig {
        methods: ["GET"],
        path: "quote"
    }
    resource function quote(http:Caller caller, http:Request request) {
        http:Response response = new;
        response.setTextPayload("12000.00");
        error? respond = caller->respond(response);
    }
}
```

* Now let's open the `main.bal` file and add the following content. This is going to be our integration logic.

**main.bal**

```ballerina
import ballerina/http;

http:Client abcEP = new("http://localhost:8081/abc/quote");
http:Client xyzEP = new("http://localhost:8082/xyz/quote");

@http:ServiceConfig {
    basePath: "/stocktrading"
}
service stockQuote on new http:Listener(9090) {
    @http:ResourceConfig {
        methods: ["GET"],
        path: "/stockquote"
    }
    resource function getQuote(http:Caller caller, http:Request req) returns error?{
        var company = req.getQueryParamValue("company");
        http:Response response = new;
        match company {
            "abc" => {
                response = checkpanic abcEP->get("/");
            }
            "xyz" => {
                response = checkpanic xyzEP->get("/");
            }
            _ => {
                response.statusCode = http:STATUS_BAD_REQUEST;
                response.setTextPayload("No matching company found.");
            }
        }        
        error? respond = caller->respond(response);
    }    
}
```

Here we are calling the two services we created earlier using the endpoints `abcEP` and `xyzEP`.

In the stockQuote service, the `company` is retrieved as a query parameter. Then the value of the `company` is checked. If it is `abc`, the `abcEP` is called and its response is saved. If it is `xyz`, the `xyzEP` is called. If there is no value set, we’re simply setting a 400-Bad Request response. Finally the response is sent back to the client.

## Testing

* First let’s build the module. While being in the content-based-routing directory, execute the following command.

```bash
$ ballerina build content_based_routing
```

This would create the executables.

* Now run the .jar file created in the above step.

```bash
$ java -jar target/bin/content_based_routing.jar
```

Now we can see that three service have started on ports 8081, 8082, and 9090. 

* Let’s access the stockQuote service by executing the following curl command.

```bash
$ curl http://localhost:9090/stocktrading/stockquote?company=abc
```

We will get a text value 10000.00 as the response.
