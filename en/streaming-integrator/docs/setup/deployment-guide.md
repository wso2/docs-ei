# Deployment

WSO2 Streaming Integrator(SI) is designed to deploy enterprise grade critical systems which demands high 
reliability, availability and performance. Thus, WSO2 SI is designed with support for deployment options which can 
handle increasing system loads (scalability) and provide near-zero downtime and by eliminate single point of failure 
(high availability). Furthermore, some of the key characteristics of WSO2 SI deployment architecture are ease of 
installation and deployment, high maintainability and DevOps friendliness.

Mainly following three deployment options can be followed, 

 - [Single Node Deployment](deploying-si-as-a-single-deployment.md)
 - [Minimum High Available(HA) Deployment](deploying-si-as-minimum-ha-cluster.md)
 - [Scalable High Available(HA) Deployment](deploying-si-as-a-scalable-cluster.md)
